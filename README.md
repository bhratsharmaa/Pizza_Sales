# Suggestions
### 1) Promotion Strategies:
 special promotions or discounts during the weekends, especially on Fridays and Saturdays should be given to capitalize on the higher order volume during those times

 ### 2) Pizza Size Focus:
 Given that large-sized pizzas contribute significantly to sales, consider expanding the variety of large pizzas or running promotions that encourage customers to choose larger sizes.

 ### 3) Pizza Category Enhancement:
Expand the classic pizza category by introducing new classic pizza options or variations to maintain and increase sales in this popular category..


 ### 4) Low-Revenue Pizza Evaluation:
 Review the performance of the lowest revenue pizzas, such as The Brie Carrie Pizza. Assess whether it's worth reimagining these items or discontinuing them from the menu.

 ### 5) Inventory Planning:

 Plan inventory management strategies to meet the demand for popular pizza options during peak times, ensuring no stockouts or delays.
