## Objective :

The primary objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data and leverage the insights to develop visually appealing dashboards. These dashboards are designed to assist the management in making informed decisions to enhance sales and overall business performance.


## Project Description :

### 1) Data Import to MS SQL Server:

The project began by importing raw data into Microsoft SQL Server, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and security. This process involved data cleansing and transformation to prepare it for analysis.

### 2) SQL Queries:

The power of SQL queries was harnessed to extract valuable insights from the dataset. This included data aggregation, filtering, and joining multiple tables to create a coherent dataset for visualization.

### 3) Data Import to Power BI:

To leverage Power BI's robust visualization capabilities, the processed data was seamlessly imported from SQL Server into Power BI, creating a strong foundation for visualizations.

### 4) DAX Queries:

The Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language allowed us to perform advanced calculations and create calculated columns and measures, adding depth to our analysis. This step was crucial in uncovering hidden patterns and trends within the data.

### 5) Chart Building:

The project came to life with captivating charts and visualizations. The appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots) were carefully selected to represent data insights effectively. Color schemes and formatting were thoughtfully chosen to enhance the overall aesthetic.

### 6) Dashboard Creation:

To provide a holistic view of the analysis, interactive dashboards were designed to allow users to explore data intuitively. These dashboards incorporated multiple charts, slicers, and filters, enabling users to customize their experience and gain insights tailored to their needs.

# Suggestions
### 1) Promotion Strategies:
 special promotions or discounts during the weekends, especially on Fridays and Saturdays should be given to capitalize on the higher order volume during those times

 ### 2) Pizza Size Focus:
 Given that large-sized pizzas contribute significantly to sales, consider expanding the variety of large pizzas or running promotions that encourage customers to choose larger sizes.

 ### 3) Pizza Category Enhancement:
Expand the classic pizza category by introducing new classic pizza options or variations to maintain and increase sales in this popular category..


 ### 4) Low-Revenue Pizza Evaluation:
 Review the performance of the lowest revenue pizzas, such as The Brie Carrie Pizza. Assess whether it's worth reimagining these items or discontinuing them from the menu.

 ### 5) Inventory Planning:

 Plan inventory management strategies to meet the demand for popular pizza options during peak times, ensuring no stockouts or delays.
